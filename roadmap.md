# Roadmap....

1. Just have a list of plugins and download it.
2. Check Minecraft version compatibility.
3. Update the plugins.
4. Inter plugin dependencies.
5. Inter plugin dependencies by versions.


6. Create plugin.json file format
7. Create commands
8. I suck dick

We have to define the names of the plugin. Because devs put stupid emojis and versions in plugin name
Rename the jar to the plugin name without a version or other spam.
